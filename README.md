## JUnit Test Suite for RESTful APIs using Rest Assured

This JUnit test suite is designed to test the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE RESTful APIs of [Dummy API](https://dummyapi.io/) using the Rest Assured library. The purpose of these tests is to validate the functionality of the APIs and ensure that they meet the specified requirements. This test suite covers the following endpoints:

1. GET /users - Retrieve a list of users.
2. GET /users/{id} - Retrieve the details of a specific user.
3. POST /users - Create a new user.
4. PUT /users/{id} - Update an existing user.
5. DELETE /users/{id} - Delete a specific user.

### Prerequisites

- Java development environment
- JUnit library
- Rest Assured library
- REST client tool (e.g. Postman, cURL)

### Test Environment

It is important to have a dedicated test environment that is separate from the production environment. This will prevent any potential harm to the live system during the testing process.

### Test Data

In order to perform reliable tests, it is important to have a set of test data that represents the various scenarios that the APIs may encounter in real-world use. This data should be stored in a database or file and should be easily accessible for the tests.

### Test Cases

The test suite consists of the following test cases:

1. GET /users Tests: validate that the GET /users API returns the correct response and data for various requests using Rest Assured.

2. GET /users/{id} Tests: validate that the GET /users/{id} API returns the correct response and data for a specific user using Rest Assured.

3. POST /users Tests: validate that the POST /users API correctly creates a new user and returns the correct response and data using Rest Assured.

4. PUT /users/{id} Tests: validate that the PUT /users/{id} API correctly updates an existing user and returns the correct response and data using Rest Assured.

5. DELETE /users/{id} Tests: validate that the DELETE /users/{id} API correctly deletes a specific user and returns the correct response and data using Rest Assured.

### Test Automation

By using the Rest Assured library, you can easily perform HTTP requests and test the responses, making test automation more efficient and effective.

### Running the Tests

1. Clone or download the test suite.

2. Import the test suite into your Java development environment.

3. Update the test data and configurations as necessary.

4. Run the tests using JUnit.

### Conclusion

This JUnit test suite using the Rest Assured library is designed to validate the functionality, reliability, and performance of your GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE RESTful APIs for user management. By running these tests regularly, you can ensure the quality and stability of your APIs and deliver a reliable and functional product to your users.
